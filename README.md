Simple script in python3, although there are websites where it is possible to encode and decode in "base64", the objective 

is to be able to perform this task with excellence via terminal.

Remembering that Kali Linux, Parrot os and others intended for pentesting this is possible by default, via the base64 terminal.

However, in certain environments where these are not used, I present this script option, just have Python version 3.7 installed.

Use:

python3 encode_decode.py

Or

sudo python3 encode_decode.py

Thanks for using it.
